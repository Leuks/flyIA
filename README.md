# flyIA

A butterflies simulation based on genetic algorithms.

You may start a simulation by indicating the number of generations and the number of butterflies per generation.
The simulation will stop when it has reached the indicated number of generations or if there is no better result since 10 generations.
At the end of the simulation, neural networks weights of the best butterfly are downloaded.

You may load weights from a file picker in order to start a modelisation with one butterfly setted up with the loaded weights and see how it evolves.
